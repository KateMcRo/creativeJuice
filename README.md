# Creative Juice

## Description

This is an interactive front-end application that helps people break out of creative blocks. The website utilizes the WordAPI provided thorugh the RapidAPI site, as well as, the AIColorGenerator by Hotpot.ai.

Users input their starting color choice and a word. The app returns a 5 color palette and a selection of synonyms. If the user isn't satisfied with these options they can retry either input independently. Once they have elements that inspire them, they can save them to the "favorites" dropdowns.

We wanted to make a practical application to help ignite creativity. This application offers a simple way to overcome a lack of inspiration.

In the process of building this, we learned many lessons which included the importance of:
- Branch management
- Coordinating the linking of all portions of the code
- Troubleshooting problems/pivoting as a team
